# PwC-Virtual-Internship
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the need for continuous learning and adaptation has become more crucial than ever. Digital upskilling, the process of acquiring new or enhancing existing digital skills, has emerged as a fundamental strategy for individuals and organizations alike to thrive in this digital age. Whether it's mastering data analysis, honing programming languages, or understanding emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain, digital upskilling empowers individuals to stay relevant, competitive, and resilient in an increasingly digital-centric world.

Recognizing the importance of staying ahead in this digital revolution, I've decided to embark on a journey of self-improvement by enrolling in two courses offered by PwC's virtual internship program: Power BI and Digital Intelligence. These courses not only provide theoretical knowledge but also offer practical, hands-on experience, allowing me to develop tangible skills that are directly applicable in real-world scenarios. Through these courses, I aim to not only enhance my expertise but also contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving digital landscape.

## Power BI - Virtual Internship 
### Task 1 & 2 - Analysing Call Center Trends
 I created a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI, visualizing various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics from the dataset. These included:
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant
The creation of this dashboard not only allowed me to explore the dataset but also enabled me to gain practical experience in visualizing and interpreting call center trends effectively.
### Task 3 - Curstomer Retention Analysis 
In Task 3, my focus shifted towards Customer Retention Analysis. This task required defining appropriate KPIs tailored to the dataset, followed by the creation of a dashboard specifically designed for the retention manager. The defined KPIs aimed to track the customer retention rate effectively, ensuring a proactive approach towards retaining valuable clientele. Furthermore, I elucidated the insights derived from the dashboard and provided actionable suggestions to enhance customer retention strategies.
### Task 4 - Diversity & Inclusion
Task 4 revolved around Diversity & Inclusion, particularly examining gender balance within the executive suite. I undertook the challenge of measuring and analyzing gender representation, culminating in the identification of KPIs based on the dataset. These KPIs encompassed metrics such as the number of men and women in executive roles, turnover rates, promotion percentages, and performance ratings.
